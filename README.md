## About Me
Iâ€™m a Deep Learning Software Engineer at NVIDIA, New Jersey. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at Learning Systems Laborator (LSL), Department of Electrical Engineering, New York University where I worked under the aegis of Dr. Anna Choromanska.

## Research Interest
I started my journey with deep interest in medical image processing specifically high frequency ultrasound imaging. Over the past few months I've been working at the intersection of sample complexity, generalization and loss landscape of deep neural networks. I will be happy to chat with you about any of my projects, ou can reach me at bisla@nyu.edu.
