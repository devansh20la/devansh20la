## About Me
I'm a PhD student under the aegis of [Dr. Anna Choromanska](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-choromanska) at the Machine Learning Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, New York University.

## Research Interest
I started my journey with deep interest in medical image processing specifically high frequency ultrasound imageing. Over the past few months I've been working at the intersection of sample complexity, generalization and loss landscape of deep neural networks. I will be happy to chat with you about any of my projects, ou can reach me at bisla@nyu.edu.
